In this section, we look at some of the fundamentals of the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for research projects that will make your life easier.\nAlthough we could use a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel or Google sheets to analyze our data, these tools are limited in their flexibility and accessibility. Critically, they also are difficult to share steps which explore and change the raw data, which is key to “reproducible” research.\nTherefore, these notes will help you begin exploring your data using R and RStudio. The R program is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and is a freely-available where you downloaded it above. To run R, all you need is the R program.\nHowever, to make using R easier, we will use the program RStudio, which we also downloaded above. RStudio is a free, open-source, Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms (including on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control and project management."

Can you calculate the average income for ASEAN countries? By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!\nBasic layout\nWhen you first open RStudio, you will see three panels:\n\nThe interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)\nEnvironment/History/Connections (tabbed in upper right)\nFiles/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)\n\n\nOnce you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open in the top left. You can start a new R script by going to the “File” menu, and choosing “New File”, then “R script” (both of these choices are at the top).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Scripts\n\n\n\nAny commands that you write in the R console can be saved to a file to be re-run again. Files containing R code to be ran in this way are called R scripts. R scripts have .R at the ends of their names to let you know what they are."

You can copy the R commands by hovering on the right edge of the grey box and clicking on the clipboard.

For example, to calculate the square-root of 36, type\n\nsqrt(36)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nThe command sqrt is known as a function. R has many built in functions: some do maths like sqrt, and some do other things. To call a function, type its name, followed by opening and closing brackets. Some functions take arguments as inputs (things typed inside the brackets). For example sqrt takes a single number as an argument (36 in the example above), and calculates its square root.\nSome functions don’t take any arguments:\n\ngetRversion() # Check what version of R you are using\n\n[1] '4.4.1'\n\n\n\ngetwd() # Check which folder any files will be written in if you decide to save something\n\n[1] \"/Users/jimstankovich/Documents/GitHub/notes2\"\n\n\n(Here we have added comments to help explain our R commands. Anything on a line after a # is ignored by R, so it is a good place to write comments.)\nOther functions take different types of arguments, for example\n\npaste0(1,\" dog\",\" and \",\"1\",\"2\", \" cats\")\n\n[1] \"1 dog and 12 cats\"\n\n\nThis example shows that R works with text as well as numbers.\nDon’t worry about trying to remember every function in R. You can look them up on Google, or if you can remember the start of the function’s name, type it and RStudio will provide some suggestions for the end of the name. For example, if you type sq, RStudio will list various functions starting with “sq”, including sqrt().\nTyping a ? before the name of a command will open the help page for the command on the bottom right. The help page includes a detailed description of the command and how it works. The bottom of the help page will usually has examples of how to use the command. (This is often the most useful part of the help page!)"

    "section": "2.7 Objects: giving names to pieces of information",
    "text": "2.7 Objects: giving names to pieces of information\nA key concept in R, and in any programming language, is to give names to pieces of data. You can give names to single numbers, a bit like x’s and y’s in algebra you did in high school, or to huge tables of data. Any name (like x or y) with something assigned to it is called an r(em2(\"object\")).\nThe -&gt; symbol is used to assign some data to an object. For example, the command\n\nx &lt;- 9\n\ncreates an object called x, and sets x equal to 9.\nTo check what value an object has, just type the name of the object:\n\nx\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nOnce x has been assigned a value, we can use it for calculations:\n\nx + 3\n\n[1] 12\n\nsqrt(x)\n\n[1] 3\n\nx^2 + 2*x + 1\n\n[1] 100\n\n(x+1)^2\n\n[1] 100\n\n\nYou can also assign a new value to x\n\nx &lt;- 42\nx\n\n[1] 42\n\n\nNote that the command x &lt;- 42 changes the value of x, but it doesn’t show us what the new value of x is. The x on the line below asks R to show us the value of x.\nYou can also change the value of x based on what its previous value was:\n\nx &lt;- x + 1\nx\n\n[1] 43\n\n\nTo interpret the command x &lt;- x + 1, start on the right. x + 1 means take the current value of x (42) and add 1 to it (43). The arrow pointing to the left says: take the new value you calculated on the right (43) and assign it to the thing on the left (x).\nIf you prefer, you can use longer names for objects that are more informative than x, such as\n\npopulation_of_thailand_2022 &lt;- 71.7 * 10^6\n\n\nthailandPop22 &lt;- 71.7 * 10^6\n\nThese names can only include letters, numbers, _, and ., and names must start with a letter. So the following names are invalid:\n\n22pop (cannot start with numbers)\nthailand pop (cannot have spaces)\npop-22 (cannot have a -)\n\nIf you use long names, you don’t have to type them in full every time. Once RStudio knows that you have created an object called population_of_thailand_2022, it will suggest the full name after you type the first few characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWhat are the values of mass and age after the following commands are run?\n\nmass &lt;- 47.5\nage &lt;- 122\nmass &lt;- mass * 2.3\nage &lt;- age - 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmass &lt;- 47.5\n\nThis gives the object mass a value of 47.5.\n\nage &lt;- 122\n\nThis gives the object mass a value of 122.\n\nmass &lt;- mass * 2.3\n\nThis takes the existing value of mass (47.5) and multiplies it by 2.3 to give it a new value of 109.25.\n\nage &lt;- age - 20\n\nThis will subtract 20 from the existing value of 122 to give age a new value of 102.\n\n\n\nObjects can store other types of information, not just numbers. For example, they can store text:\n\nname_of_country &lt;- \"Thailand\"\n\nObjects can also store more than one piece of information, not just a single number or a single piece of text. Two of the most important types of objects in R with multiple pieces of information are vectors and data.frames."

There are over 10,000 packages in a public collection called CRAN (the comprehensive R archive network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:\n\nYou can see what packages are installed by typing installed.packages()\nYou can install packages by typing install.packages(\"packagename\"), where packagename is the package name, in quotes.\nYou can update installed packages by typing update.packages()\nYou can remove a package with remove.packages(\"packagename\")\nYou can make a package available for use with library(packagename)\n\nPackages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages tab of the lower right panel in RStudio. Clicking on this tab will display all of the installed packages with a checkbox next to them. If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded and if it is empty, the package is not loaded. Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to detach that package.\nPackages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.\nBelow we will discuss 3 packages with some very useful functions:\n\nreadr for loading datasets into R from spreadsheets and CSV files,\ndplyr for managing datasets, and\nggplot2 for making graphs.\n\nBut before we can use these packages, we need to install them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nInstall the packages dplyr, readrand ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the install.packages() command to install the required packages.\n\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")"

    "text": "3.1 Loading data with the readr package\nLet’s load a small CSV file with some Gapminder data for 10 ASEAN countries. We will use the package readr to do this.\nI have put the CSV file on a webpage here.\nThere are two ways you can load the data into R. You can either download it onto your computer first (Method 1), or you can load it into R directly from the website (Method 2).\n\n3.1.1 Method 1: Download the data onto your computer, then load it from your computer into R\n\nGo to the URL (website) above.\nHover on the little arrow pointing down on the right. The words “Download raw file” will appear in a black box. \nClick on this arrow to download the CSV file.\nFind where the file was downloaded on your computer, and move it to a folder where you want to keep it.\nIn the “Files” window of RStudio (bottom right), navigate to the folder where you put the data, select the file, and choose “Import Dataset…” \nA new window appears, giving you some options to control how you open the file. In this case the default settings are fine… you don’t need to change anything. So just click “Import” on the bottom right to load the data. Note that the 3 R commands which will be run appear in a box on the bottom right. \nThese 3 commands run in the Console window on the bottom left. The folder in the second line will be different on your computer (not the same as \"~/Documents/Research Methodology in Social Sciences/introduction_to_R/data/\"), depending on where you put the file asean_2022_data.csv.\nCopy these 3 commands to your .R file so you can run them automatically next time, without having to open windows and click in them. This makes your analysis more “reproducible”.\n\nLet’s look at the 3 commands and what they do:\n\nlibrary(readr): The library() function makes the package readr available for use (as mentioned in Section 2.11 above).\nasean_data &lt;- read_csv(\"[path_to_folder]/asean_data.csv\"): The function read_csv is part of the readr package. Here it reads the CSV file asean_data.csv into R’s memory and gives it the name asean_data. (We could call it something else if we wanted to.) Some information appears in the Console window about the data. The country column has text information (character or “chr” for short). The other 4 columns (year, pop, lifeExp, gdpPercap) have numerical information (stored as “double-precision” numbers, or “dbl” for short… don’t worry about this computer science terminology if you haven’t heard it before).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView(asean_data): This command opens a spreadsheet-style view of the data on the top-left. If you close this window the data is stored in R… it is just a “view” of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you load the data, asean_data also appears in the “Environment” window on the top-right. If you click the little blue arrow, it provides some information on the variables in the data:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, 3 of the 4 windows in RStudio are showing similar information about the data we have just loaded. :) It is up to you to decide which way(s) of looking at the data are most helpful.\nYet another way to look at the data is to type the name of the dataset in the Console window:\n\nasean_data\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 5\n   country      year       pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Brunei       2012    407000    74       67800\n 2 Brunei       2022    449000    74.2     58700\n 3 Indonesia    2012 250000000    69.8      9020\n 4 Indonesia    2022 276000000    69.1     12400\n 5 Cambodia     2012  14800000    67.9      3020\n 6 Cambodia     2022  16800000    69.1      4530\n 7 Lao          2012   6510000    66.2      5430\n 8 Lao          2022   7530000    69.8      7950\n 9 Myanmar      2012  50200000    66.1      3190\n10 Myanmar      2022  54200000    70.1      4120\n11 Malaysia     2012  29700000    74.8     21700\n12 Malaysia     2022  33900000    75.5     28300\n13 Philippines  2012  98000000    70.7      6300\n14 Philippines  2022 116000000    72.2      8580\n15 Singapore    2012   5380000    83.3     82900\n16 Singapore    2022   5980000    85.2    108000\n17 Thailand     2012  69200000    77.7     15100\n18 Thailand     2022  71700000    79.1     17500\n19 Vietnam      2012  89300000    73.5      6950\n20 Vietnam      2022  98200000    75       11400\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Method 2: Download the data directly into R from the internet\nStarting at the same URL as before (https://github.com/jimstankovich/notes/blob/main/data/asean_data.csv), click on the word “Raw” on the top right. This takes you take another webpage with the “raw” (unformatted) CSV data. You can use the read_csv command to load the data from this webpage:\n\nlibrary(readr)\nasean_data &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimstankovich/notes/main/data/asean_data.csv\")\n\nMethod 2 is fine for the small dataset we are looking at here. However, if you are running your R commands many times and working with a large dataset, it is better to download the dataset onto your computer first (Method 1), rather than downloading a large dataset many times."

    "text": "3.2 Using the dplyr package to look at the asean_data\nI use the dplyr package more than any other packages. It is very useful for managing datasets: cleaning them, joining them, and selecting smaller sections for statistical analysis.\nLet’s look at how a few dplyr functions can be applied to the asean_data.\n\n3.2.1 Calculate the total population of the ASEAN countries\nSuppose we want to know the total population of the 10 ASEAN countries in 2022. We can do this by adding up the values of pop in the rows from 2022. Let’s do this in 2 steps:\n\nCreate a smaller dataset that only includes rows with 2022 data.\nAdd up the values in the column/vector pop.\n\n\nStep 1\ndplyr has a command called filter() for selecting particular rows of a dataset. The filter() command takes two arguments\n\nthe name of a data.frame\na condition to satisfy: only include rows where this condition is TRUE\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nasean_2022 &lt;- filter(asean_data, year == 2022)\nasean_2022\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   country      year       pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Brunei       2022    449000    74.2     58700\n 2 Indonesia    2022 276000000    69.1     12400\n 3 Cambodia     2022  16800000    69.1      4530\n 4 Lao          2022   7530000    69.8      7950\n 5 Myanmar      2022  54200000    70.1      4120\n 6 Malaysia     2022  33900000    75.5     28300\n 7 Philippines  2022 116000000    72.2      8580\n 8 Singapore    2022   5980000    85.2    108000\n 9 Thailand     2022  71700000    79.1     17500\n10 Vietnam      2022  98200000    75       11400\n\n\nMany dplyr functions take the name of a data.frame as the first argument. There is an alternative notation for running these functions, where you put the name of the data.frame before the function, then join it to the function using the symbol %&gt;%\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nasean_2022 &lt;- asean_data %&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2022)\nasean_2022\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   country      year       pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Brunei       2022    449000    74.2     58700\n 2 Indonesia    2022 276000000    69.1     12400\n 3 Cambodia     2022  16800000    69.1      4530\n 4 Lao          2022   7530000    69.8      7950\n 5 Myanmar      2022  54200000    70.1      4120\n 6 Malaysia     2022  33900000    75.5     28300\n 7 Philippines  2022 116000000    72.2      8580\n 8 Singapore    2022   5980000    85.2    108000\n 9 Thailand     2022  71700000    79.1     17500\n10 Vietnam      2022  98200000    75       11400\n\n\nI think this notation makes it clearer that we are starting with the asean_data data.frame, then applying the filter() function to make changes to it and produce asean_2022.\nThe %&gt;% notation is particularly good when you want to apply several functions to a data.frame. Below are two pieces of code that do the same thing… which do you think is easier to read?\n\nlarge_wealthy_country &lt;- \n  filter(filter(filter(asean_data, year == 2022), \n         gdpPercap &gt; 20000), pop &gt; 10e6)  # 10e6 is 10 million \nlarge_wealthy_country\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  country   year      pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Malaysia  2022 33900000    75.5     28300\n\n\n\nlarge_wealthy_country &lt;- asean_data %&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2022) %&gt;%\n  filter(gdpPercap &gt; 20000) %&gt;%\n  filter(pop &gt; 10e6)  # 10e6 is 10 million\nlarge_wealthy_country\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  country   year      pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Malaysia  2022 33900000    75.5     28300\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\nNow we can use the sum() function to add up the values of pop in asean_2022:\n\nasean_pop_2022 &lt;- sum(asean_2022$pop)\nasean_pop_2022\n\n[1] 680759000\n\n\nSo the total population of the ASEAN countries in 2022 was nearly 681 million.

However, many people recommend ggplot2 for graphs, so I am trying it out. I don’t yet understand the “grammar of graphics” used in ggplot2, so I’m definitely not qualified to teach anyone how to use it! Nevertheless, I’m still including this section to\n\ngive a bit of a flavour of how ggplot2 commands look, and\nhelp persuade you that graphs can be a very useful tool for helping communicate your research findings.\n\nI did a lot of googling to make the graphs below. I have included links to some pages that helped.\nI was impressed how fast it was to make some fairly complicated graphs with ggplot2, so I think I’ll start using it more to explore data.
