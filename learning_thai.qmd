Over the past few months I've been enjoying Thai lessons at the [Sumaa Language and Culture Institute](https://www.sumaa.net/). Previously I learnt Thai and did a study tour in Thailand with the amazing [Ajarn Chintana Sandilands](https://chl-archive.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/1065/chintana-sandilands-honoured-lifetime-achievement-award) at Australian National University.

Here's [another website](https://jimstankovich.github.io/translation/) I maintain with some attempts to translate Thai into English. 

My favourite online Thai-English dictionaries:

- [SEAlang Library Thai](http://sealang.net/thai/)

- [NAVER English-Thai Dictionary](https://english.dict.naver.com/english-thai-dictionary/)

- [thailanguage.com](http://www.thai-language.com/)
