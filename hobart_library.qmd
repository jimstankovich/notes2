I miss walking in Hobart... here in Bangkok it's normally way too hot to walk anywhere if you don't want to arrive drenched in sweat! And I miss the [Hobart Library](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/locations/hobart-library/). Go in, sit down, connect to the wifi, and concentrate on something with a magnificent view of Mt Wellington off to the side. No registration, no handing over your passport, no depositing your bag, no passwords, plenty of natural light, powerpoints and places to sit, but always other punters around to provide some atmosphere. 

However, it's not all bad news here in Bangkok. I'm planning to write some notes here about my favourite places to sit and work or study. Top of the my list at the moment is where I'm sitting now: [Tim Hortons](https://timhortons.co.th/) at [Samyan Mitrtown](https://www.samyan-mitrtown.com/en/).
